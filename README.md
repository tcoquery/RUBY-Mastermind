# Mastermind

Second Ruby project, this one involved much more logic than the Tic-Tac-Toe project as well as comprehensive use of classes and modules.

The main difficulties relied on checking the user's guess against the secret code and output the correct clues. 

The computer solving part involves an algorithm to first find the four correct numbers of the player's code and then chance to find the correct combination. 

While it is possible to implement an algorithm that lets the computer win every time, it wouldn't be very fun for the player.

I also learned how to show colors in the terminal as well.
